## Course Structure Overview: 

This repository contains materials for a comprehensive course on quantitative finance and financial mathematics, structured as a progressive learning journey from foundational concepts to advanced applications.

The course begins with essential mathematical frameworks, including filtrations and measure changes, which form the basis for exposure simulation and XVA calculations. It then explores interest rate modeling through the Heath-Jarrow-Morton (HJM) framework and short rate models like Hull-White, examining their implications for yield curve dynamics.

As the course progresses, it covers practical applications such as pricing interest rate products (swaps, swaptions), yield curve construction, and handling challenges like negative interest rates. Specialized topics include mortgage prepayment modeling, hybrid models for multi-asset simulation, and foreign exchange/inflation modeling.

Advanced sections delve into market models (LIBOR Market Model), convexity adjustments, exposure calculations (CVA, BCVA, FVA), and risk management techniques (VaR, Expected Shortfall). The course concludes with a comprehensive summary of key concepts and tools.

Each lecture builds on previous knowledge, providing both theoretical understanding and practical implementation insights for quantitative finance professionals.
